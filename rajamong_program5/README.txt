How to Access on the OS1 Engineering Server:

//enter my assignment directory

cd CS344_HW5



How to Compile My Program:

// due to the fact that I have been testing my program using my PuTTy terminal,
// using the '2>&1' at the end caused the error "ambiguous output redirect", I
// was advised to mention this in my README.txt due to the fact this is a PuTTy
// terminal related issue, and not an issue with my program or compiler !!

// NOTE: not sure if all programs take really long to finish outputting, but 
	 mine takes a little while before it has completely finished running


bash compileall.sh
./p5testscript randomNumber1 randomNumber2 > mytestresults
